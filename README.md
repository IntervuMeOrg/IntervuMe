## 📚 Background

The hiring process for software engineering roles usually involves:

1. **Resume Screening**
2. **Online Assessments**
3. **Technical Interviews**
4. **Behavioral Interviews**
5. **Final Decision**

Many candidates are underprepared due to the lack of realistic practice and feedback, making it difficult to excel in this competitive process.
